                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging from a public health perspective. The magnitude of the global threat from this virus was underestimated early on by many health authorities as attempts at containment and mitigation were made. As it became clear that the virus would become an established threat, achieving a balanced portfolio of antiviral agents, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines was challenging to accomplish, given competing priorities and limited resources. In addition, manufacturing capacity across the globe was not sufficient to immediately rise to the scale of production necessary for the diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, vaccines and personal protective equipment needed to combat the pandemic. Even though these issues have now been at least partially addressed, the global deployment of vaccines that aim to bring the outbreak under control has been complicated by political and social media disinformation campaigns that work against the public health.</p>

                            <p>One positive consequence of the ongoing pandemic for the public has been a heightened external awareness of the work of regulators and the innovative regulatory pathways that can be used to facilitate the availability of crucial medical products in an emergency. There has been some apprehension about the pace of the development of medical products during the pandemic, with some voicing concerns regarding the investigational nature of vaccines and other products that were made available under Emergency Use Authorization in the United States. Therefore, it has been critical to ensure that the development, review and authorization and approval process is as open and transparent as possible. This has included: providing clear standards for product development and review in regulatory guidance documents; making review documents public; holding open, easily accessible advisory committee meetings; and having senior agency staff speak to the public whenever possible about the evidence and decision making regarding COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutic agents and vaccines.</p>
